<h3>"gameExample" is a game without a story. This game is solely built for the purpose of helping me understand how games work and how many mechanics are built. The main goal behind this project is to create something that I can use as a base for future projects. Therefore, I plan to add a lot.</h3>

<h1>CONTROLS</h1>

<h3><u>PAUSE MENU</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>"W" and "D" are used to scroll up and down the menu buttons.</li>
    <li>"A" and "D" are used to scroll left and right between the options of a button.</li>
    <li>Pressing "K" will select the highlighted button.</li>
    <li>Pressing "L" will return you back to the previous menu page.</li>
    <li>Pressing "Z" will return you back to the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>GAME</u></h3>
<ul>
    <li>"W", "A", "S", and "D" are d-pad buttons. This means they will mainly be used for movement.</li>
    <li>"I", "J", "K", and "L" are action buttons. This means they will be used to perform certain actions, depending on the scenario.</li>
    <li>Pressing "Z" will take you to the pause menu.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>TIPS</h1>
<ul>
    <li>If you hold "K" while pressing a d-pad button, your player will run. There are two bars located in the top right corner of the screen: health and stamina. If your stamina runs out, the character will slow to a walking pace.</li>
    <li>If you want to change the dimensions or placements of the screen and buttons, you can go to the pause menu, click "Other Options", and find them all there.</li>
    <li>If you want to change the colors of everything in the pause screen, click on "Change Menu Background". For each option, there are multiple options to choose from, including a randomizing button and a creation button. If the creation button is clicked, it will send you to another menu in which you will be able to choose the exact color you want.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h1>FUTURE PLANS</h1>
<h3>There are many things that I plan to add, but these are the ones that will be implemented in the near future:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Finish the "color creation menu"</li>
    <li>Finish "d-pad menu"</li>
    <li>Finish "view credits menu"</li>
    <li>Add the pause button for users without keyboards</li>
</ul>
